# Student Project for Semester 6, Bachelor in Computer Science
The project is based on the paper "Public Key Compression and Modulus Switching for Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers" by 
Jean-Sebastien Coron, David Naccache and Mehdi Tibouchi . Addtionaly, there are 2 implementation of lattice attacks from the papers -
"Lattice Attacks on the DGHV Homomorphic Encryption Scheme" - Abderrahmane Nitaj and Tajjeeddine Rachidi and
"Cryptanalysis of a Homomorphic Encryption Scheme Over Integers" - Jingguo Bi, Jiayang Liu, and Xiaoyun Wang
# Notes
This is just a student project, the code is not meant for usage in the real world.
